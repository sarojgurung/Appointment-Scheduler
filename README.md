### Frameworks Used

React Library, JSX, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Moment.JS

### WorkFlow / Scope

The Appointment Scheduler is a one page web app with React Components used to display the content. 

The appointment is to be done in 3 easy steps.
1. First The User is allowed to enter a name and start the appointment process. 
2. The user selects the Coach from the list of Coaches.
3. The user then selects a 30 minute session from the available times for respective Coach.

### Styling

The Appointment is mostly using the bootstrap framework and some custom styling.
The light color was chosed so that it would be easy to read and keep the interface as clean as possible. 

### Unachieved goals
1. Unable to save the appointment to the localserver or webserver
2. Usage of Bootstrap styling rather than custom styling
3. Validation on the input username and logout

### Conclusion
Despite being unable to finish the project, I was able to decode and learn new ways to think in react.
